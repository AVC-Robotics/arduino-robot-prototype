- [Distance sensor](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/complete-guide-for-ultrasonic-sensor-hc-sr04/)
- [Adafruit Trinket Rover](https://learn.adafruit.com/trinket-powered-rover/red-rover), the kit that this prototype is based on. Note that we are using the Arduino instead of the Trinket, and we have a different sensor. Otherwise, the kit is the same.
